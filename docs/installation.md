## Requirements

The soda CLI only needs Python 3.7+

To check your version of python, run the `python` command
```
$ python --version
Python 3.7.7
```

If you don't have Python, [install it from Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once Python is installed, you should also have `pip`.

## Installing CLI using PyPI

```
$ pip install soda-sql
```
