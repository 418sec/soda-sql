<p>Soda SQL is currently in beta. While the codebase is quite young, it does build upon our 
experience of many field implementations and customer inputs.</p>

<p>We have seen many home grown solutions for this problem.  With this project, we want to 
combine our expertise with these efforts and jointly build something that any individual party 
could not achieve.</p>
